                <p>
                    Legendary Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo launched his YouTube channel on Wednesday, 
                    21 August. The former Real Madrid star's fans flocked to YouTube to subscribe to his channel 
                    and learn what his life is like behind the scenes. The rush was so great that Ronaldo broke 
                    the YouTube record for fastest to 1 million subscribers. Ronaldo achieved the feat in just 90 
                    minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only that, Ronaldo's channel now has over 11 million subscribers, less than a day after its 
                    launch. The football star had announced the start of his YouTube channel via his social media accounts 
                    where he has a massive following.

                    <p>
                        Ronaldo has 112.5 million followers on the X platform, 170 million on Facebook and 636 million on Instagram.

                        "The wait is over. My @YouTube channel is finally here! SIUUUbscribe and join me on this new journey," 
                        Ronaldo posted on his social media
                    </p>

                    <p>A couple of hours after posting his first video, 1.69M subscribers had joined the channel.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest footballers of all time, Ronaldo currently plays for Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. 
                    The footballer recently featured in the Euro 2024 but was not able to guide his team to a title. The legendary
                     footballer is currently 39 years of age and in the last strides of his career. His impeccable physical fitness has
                      meant that he has shown no signs of stopping, but his natural ability as a goalscorer has waned. Ronaldo's European 
                      campaign was the best example of that, where he was not able to produce goals from inside the box when his team desperately
                       needed him to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is expected that Ronaldo will slowly move into content creation and other businesses that he holds once he retires.
