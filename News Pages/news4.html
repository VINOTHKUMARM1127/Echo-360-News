                </div>
                <p>
                    Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan announced his retirement from both domestic and international cricket on Saturday. 
                    The 38-year-old took to social media to share a heartfelt video message, expressing his gratitude to fans for their
                     unwavering support throughout his career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dhawan said he leaves the scene a content man, having represented the national team in all three formats since
                     making his international debut in 2010 in an ODI against Australia in Visakhapatnam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As I close this chapter of my cricketing journey, I carry with me countless memories and gratitude.
                     Thank you for the love and support! Jai Hind!," Dhawan said in a post on 'X'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's important to turn the page to move forward in life and that's why I am announcing my retirement
                     from international and domestic cricket. I am leaving with peace in my heart that I played so long for India," he added.

                    <h4>A look at Shikhar Dhawan's career</h4>
                <p>
                    The Delhi-born cricketer had a rough start to his international career, getting out for a duck on his debut. However, 
                    after initial challenges, Dhawan made a strong comeback in 2013, securing his place in all formats with standout performances,
                     including being named Player of the Tournament during India's victorious Champions Trophy campaign in England.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of his career highlights was his impressive 185 on Test debut against Australia in Mohali, where he reached his century
                     in just 85 balls, thanks to a flurry of boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dhawan's Test debut almost ended before it began when Mitchell Starc's first delivery accidentally struck the stumps with 
                    Dhawan out of his ground at the non-striker's end. The Australians chose not to appeal, allowing Dhawan to set the record 
                    for the fastest century by a debutant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At his peak, Dhawan's aggressive play and powerful hitting made him a standout performer. He consistently acknowledged the support 
                    he received, forming a successful partnership with Rohit Sharma at the top of the Indian batting lineup.
                </p>
                <h4>Dhawan's IPL career</h4>
                <p>
                    Dhawan is also a notable IPL player, having appeared in 222 matches and scoring 6,769 runs, including two centuries and 51 half-centuries.
                    He holds the record for the most fours (768) in the tournament and was the first to hit consecutive centuries. He played a key role in the 
                    Sunrisers Hyderabad's 2016 title win and has also played for Delhi, Mumbai, and Punjab, captaining Delhi and Punjab at various times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This season, he played for Punjab but was limited to five matches due to fitness issues.
