                    Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) hosted its Annual General Meeting (AGM) for 2024, today, August 29. The 
                    event livestream opened with an AI-generated Mukesh Ambani almost-gliding through the stage. AI was a critical 
                    theme of the RIL AGM this year. "AI is the most evolutionary progress for the human race", said RIL chairman Mukesh
                     Ambani at his opening address. Announcing the company's interest in AI development, Ambani also said that one "cannot 
                     ignore the stark developmental disparity amid rising aspirations" when it comes to artificial intelligence. Ambani 
                     announced, "we have built an AI native digital infrastructure for all Reliance businesses." "We are accelerating 
                     India's transformation into a deep tech nation," he added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "AI has become integral to everything we do", says Ambani. "We are integrating AI in all our processes and offerings", 
                    which he says helps in offering better servies both internally and to RIL customers. Ambani also spoke about something 
                    called "JioBrain", which is a "comprehensive suite of tools and platforms that span the entire AI lifecycle". It enables
                     the company, says Ambani, to accelerate AI adoption across Jio to better understand trends and offer better services."AI
                      for everyone, everywhere," is Jio's new motto, says Ambani.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "AI should not be a luxury..It should not be limited to only premium devices," says Ambani. Calling it "Connected Intelligence", 
                    Ambani says AI should be available to all at low latency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ambani also announced Jio AI-Cloud Welcome offer.

                <p>
                    "Jio users will get up to 100 GB of free cloud storage, to securely store and access all their photos, videos, documents, all other
                     digital content, and data", the RIL chairman announced."We will also have the most affordable prices in the market for those needing
                      even higher storage.We plan to launch the Jio AI-Cloud Welcome offer starting Diwali this year, bringing a powerful and affordable
                       solution where cloud data storage and data-powered AI services are available to everyone everywhere".

                <p>
                    Ambani also addressed Jio's development in India. "Jio has transformed India into the largest data market. It carried 8 per cent of global
                     mobile traffic", says Ambani. "Jio's current data price are one-fourth of global average," he adds. The RIL chairman also announced that 
                     Jio now has 490 million users. He also shared an interesting statistic that each Jio customer uses 30GB data in a month, on average, which
                      is a 33 per cent year-on-year increase in Jio's data traffic. Jio now also has over 30 million users of its digital broadband and digital
                       television services. "We are one of the largest home service providers globally," says Ambani.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In the past year, we completed the pan-India rollout of True 5G technology. Jio True 5G now reaches every corner of India," claims Ambani.
                     "Jio True 5G has also achieved the world's fastest 5G adoption. Today, we have more than 130 million Jio True 5G users," he adds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Reliance chairman also announced that the company added 1.7 lakh jobs last month, which takes its total headcount to 6.5 lakh employees.
