                    Apple has finally announced the launch event of the iPhone 16 series. After months of leaks and rumours, 
                    the company has confirmed that its 2024 iPhones are coming soon. Apple has started sending out special Apple 
                    event invites with a mysterious message. The iPhone 16 launch event will take place on September 9.

                The brand was heavily rumoured to launch its new iPhone 16 series on September 10 but it seems that Apple might have made
                 some last-minute changes. The official Apple announcement also includes the Apple logo with a cryptic message - "It is 
                 Glowtime." Well, this sounds quite interesting, but no one really knows what it means. We will likely get clarity in the
                  coming days and hopefully before the iPhone 16 launch event  
                </p>

                The latest Apple event will include an in-person component at Apple Park but those who are interested in watching the full 
                iPhone 16 series launch event will be able to livestream it online. In India, the iPhone 16 event will start at 10:30PM, just 
                like every year. The event will likely be live-streamed via Apple's official YouTube channel.

                    Apple will likely introduce four models, including iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. 
                    The standard models are expected to receive minor upgrades. The standard and the Plus models are said to retain the old 
                    displays and camera setup but offer a new chipset, a bigger battery, a new vertical rear camera layout, and a new Action
                     button. The Pro models, on the other hand, are tipped to come with big camera upgrades, a slimmer design, a larger display 
                     with minimal bezels, a new chipset and a bigger battery. It is currently unknown whether Apple will offer faster charging 
                     or not. We do know that all the iPhone 16 models will likely come with support for Apple Intelligence features.

                        The price details have also leaked online ahead of the official Apple event. The iPhone 16 base model 
                        is tipped to cost $799 (about Rs 67,100 in India). The larger iPhone 16 Plus may cost $899 (around Rs 75,500),
                         as per leaks. The iPhone 16 Pro with 256GB might be priced at $1,099 (about Rs 92,300), and the iPhone 16 Pro 
                         Max with the same storage is tipped to start at $1,199 (around Rs 1,00,700). The India prices will likely be
                          higher, as is the case with every launch because of customs charges, among other factors.

                        Alongside these smartphones, the company is also expected to announce new watches and AirPods. After the iPhone
                         16 launch event, Apple is said to host one last event in October 2024, where it is expected to introduce a new set of Macs.
